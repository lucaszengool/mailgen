### Option 2: Move to Production Mode (For Public Launch)

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Privacy Policy page (DONE - deployed at `/privacy`)
- ‚úÖ Terms of Service page (DONE - deployed at `/terms`)
- ‚úÖ Verified domain ownership
- ‚è≥ Google verification process (1-6 weeks)

**Steps to Submit for Verification:**

#### Step 1: Update OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. APIs & Services ‚Üí OAuth consent screen
3. Fill out all required fields:

1. Go to your Railway project
2. Settings ‚Üí Domains
3. Note your Railway domain: `honest-hope-production.up.railway.app`
4. Use this in OAuth consent screen

#### Step 3: Prepare Verification Documents

Google will ask for:

1. **Video Demo:**
   - Record a screen recording showing:
   - How users connect Gmail
   - Where OAuth scopes are used
   - Privacy/terms pages
   - How email data is handled

2. **Justification for Scopes:**
```
REQUESTED SCOPES:
- gmail.send: Required to send marketing emails on behalf of users
- gmail.readonly: Required to track email opens and replies for analytics
- mail.google.com: Required for full email campaign management

MailGen is an email marketing automation platform. Users connect their
Gmail accounts to send personalized marketing campaigns. We need:
- Send permission: To send emails they create
- Read permission: To provide analytics on campaign performance
- Full scope: For comprehensive campaign management and tracking
```

3. **YouTube Video (Unlisted):**
   - Upload demo to YouTube as "Unlisted"
   - Show complete OAuth flow
   - Demonstrate how scopes are used
   - Show privacy settings

#### Step 4: Submit for Verification

1. On OAuth consent screen, click **"PUBLISH APP"**
2. Click **"Prepare for verification"**
3. Fill out the verification form:
   - App name & domain
   - Link to privacy policy & terms
   - Link to demo video
   - Justification for each scope
   - Contact information

4. Click **"Submit for verification"**

#### Step 5: Wait for Google Review

2. "How is user data stored?"
   - Answer: Encrypted OAuth tokens, not reading/storing email content
3. "How do users revoke access?"
   - Answer: Through Google account settings or app settings

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Testing Mode (Now - Next 2 months)
1. ‚úÖ Add OAuth credentials to Railway (DONE)
2. Add beta users as test users (up to 100)
3. Collect feedback and iterate
4. Build user base and case studies

### Phase 2: Submit for Production (When ready)
1. Create demo video
2. Submit verification application
3. Continue using Testing mode during review
4. Once approved, automatically becomes production

## Railway Configuration (Required Now)

### Add Environment Variables

For **honest-hope** service:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_from_console
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_from_console
```

For **mailgen** service (if separate):
```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_from_console
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret_from_console
```

### Steps:
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Select your project
3. Click **honest-hope** service
4. Click **"Variables"** tab
5. Click **"+ New Variable"**
6. Add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and its value
7. Add `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` and its value
8. Click **"Redeploy"**

After redeployment (2-3 minutes), OAuth will work!
